# PokerGame

I really like poker! It's a game I play with my family all the time. Was getting into using bots and simple ML (my stock project), and wanted to see how'd they do in a game! 

Development Progress:
 - Backend is mostly done! Pot size, game progression, player moves are all integrated
 - Dash frontend sort of works but has some bugs
 - Bots are okay-? Work in progress!
 - 

Future Steps:
 - Next step is to add more advanced bot models, maybe by pulling ML code from libraries like sklearn?
